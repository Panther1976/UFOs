# UFOs

## Overview of Project

This project was an opportunity to help Dana transform a Javascript file made up of UFO sighting information to an html webpage that will include a dynamic table. The table will allow users to interact with the data by filtering the data based on various criteria. 
The date that the users will be able to use to search events by include the following:

-	Date
-	City
-	State
-	Country
-	Shape

There will also be comments that describe the event. 

## Results

The dynamic table that we created allows users to filter the UFO sightings using the above criteria. Users can start off by simply scrolling through all the data or start to fill-in the search criterion provided. The filter allows users to tailor the search to their needs. 

## Summary

While the dynamic table is very useful, some users may find the filtering too limiting. One of the drawbacks is that the table only allows the user to filter the data and not organize the data.

### Additional Recommendations

-	The ability to sort without limiting the data:
	The table does not allow the user to organize the data. For instance, a user can look at all the shapes sighted on a given day but can not look at them in an organized way. They are not sorted by shape. 

-	The ability to search Comments:
	Having the ability to search the Comments would allow users to dive deeper into the event as it occurred. 

-	The ability to export the data:
	The ability to export the data would allow users to further manipulate the data as they saw fit.
